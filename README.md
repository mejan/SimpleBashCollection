# Simple Bash collection

This is simply a repo just for some really simple bash files.
Each script is an indivual "program".

to run the scripts do in terminal:
$ bash scriptName

#Importent 
This scripts are only tried on ubuntu 12.04-14.04, and I take no resposiblity for what might happen.

Any thing you like to change in them write a issue with subject "github: sciptName". Then I'll considering it before changing anything.
